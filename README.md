Note: Used Mongo DB whose credentials is mentioned in nodemon.json file, as a user you need not to do anything but if you are unable to connect to server that means mongodb instance is stopped due to being idle for long.
In this case please connect to Yogyata.Nilkanth@ibm.com. I will restart server again.
